      Hi, I'm Shimi — a photographer, traveler, and storyteller with a passion
      for capturing the world as I see it. Whether it's a quiet moment on the
      street, a striking portrait, or the vibrant energy of a faraway place, I
      aim to preserve the emotion and honesty in every frame. My journey with
      photography has taken me across continents, from the everyday beauty of
      urban life to the unique cultures I've encountered while traveling. Each
      photo is a piece of that journey — spontaneous, personal, and real. When
      I'm not behind the lens, I'm also a frontend developer, which gives me a
      unique eye for detail, structure, and aesthetic balance — skills that
      naturally shape how I approach photography. Thanks for stopping by. I hope
      my images speak to you as much as they speak for me.
    </p>
